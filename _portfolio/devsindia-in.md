# r/developersIndia Community Website

The [developersIndia][1] is an online community of Software Developers &
Technology enthusiasts with a presence on [Reddit][2], [Discord][3] &
[GitHub][4]. And I helped them create the community website as an open-source
project.

## What Concerns Did the Project Resolve?

The community was seeing an exponential growth rate without any effort from the
moderation team. Hence it was proof, the community could grow even further &
faster if a proper strategy was in place. And the community website attempted to
resolve those concerns.

The idea was to create a website which would be built with proper Search Engine
Optimization (SEO) in mind & let it show up on various Search Engine Results
Pages (SERPs). Further the project was built with the open-source community in
mind since the developersIndia is a communtiy of Software Developers in the
first place. And in doing so helped us garner even more community engagement for
all the other remaining project as well.

## Technology Stacked Used to Build the Project?

The website at its current stage is built using:

1. [Next.js][5] to build the project as a [React.js][6] project.
2. [TypeScript][7] for an improved developer experience.
3. [Chakra-UI][8] to quickly import & use React.js components & styling the
   aesthetics of the website.
4. [Netlify][9] for CI/CD & hosting the website for the rest of the world to
   see.
