This repository contains the source code for my personal website, available at
[**jarmos.dev**](https://jarmos.dev). The website is built with the following
tech stack:

- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com) - for building the website.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - for hosting.
- [Terraform](https://terraform.io) - for provisioning and deploying the build
  files to Vercel's infrastructure.

## About the Project

This is my **sixth attempt** at rebuilding my website entirely from scratch!
Previous versions were built with the following technologies:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - I wasn't very familiar with Hugo templates, and
  its JavaScript bundling capabilities were quite limited.
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) - many of its APIs were poorly documented,
  misleading, or sometimes even broken.
- [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) - the project isn't actively maintained, and
  contributions aren't welcomed very openly.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - I ran into several issues with it (I'll
  probably write a blog post about that someday).
- [Astro](https://astro.build) - a great tool for simple static sites, but it
  often requires reinventing the wheel when adding JavaScript-based
  interactivity.

The current version of the website is built with **Nuxt.js**, and I plan to
stick with it for the foreseeable future-unless something in the framework
significantly affects my workflow or the project's development.
