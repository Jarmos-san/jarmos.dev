**NOTE**: This article is updated to reflect the latest changes Neovim v0.7
introduces with respect to customising keybindings.

Neovim (_or even Vim_) is an excellent piece of software for any developers out
there. The ability to create custom keybindings & do pretty much anything is
testament to Vim‚Äôs popularity. And if you‚Äôve used Vim before, you should be
aware of what‚Äôs possible through custom Vim keybindings as well.

For the uninitiated, Vim‚Äôs openness towards creating custom keybindings has
pretty much no competition out there. As such, only your imagination is the
limit to what you could possibly create using custom keybindings.

Vim users are also required to have working knowledge of VimScript (_which is a
scripting language built for Vim configuration_). It‚Äôs not the most elegant
language out there & neither has it any use outside of Vim. As such, the time
investment & efforts required to pickup a redundant programming language
mightn‚Äôt be productive either. Fortunately, Neovim v0.5+ gave the community a
significant feature update to play around with & that‚Äôs the inbuilt Lua runtime.

The optional Lua runtime is also backwards compatible meaning you it's possible
to write Lua code right within VimScript. If you want to learn more about
embedding Lua code within VimScript, read the docs at: `:h lua-heredoc`. We‚Äôll
not discuss how to write Lua code within VimScript since it‚Äôs beyond the scope
of this article. But feel free to also refer to this amazing
[Neovim-Lua Guide](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide) on GitHub for a
quick reference.

If that piqued your interests & you would like continue learning about how
creating custom keybindings in Neovim is a much pleasant experience, then read
ahead. The rest of the article starts with a brief intro to the optional Lua
runtime, followed by creating a Lua function for mapping the custom keybindings.

## Introducing the Optional Lua¬†Runtime

Before we proceed further into the article, let‚Äôs briefly introduce the Lua
runtime in Neovim. Having some idea of it will help better understand the how‚Äôs
& what‚Äôs possible to create.

That said, Neovim was released with a set of some useful features. One such
feature that makes Neovim stand out is it‚Äôs
[builtin API](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html). The programmatic access to
the API & the Lua runtime means you can let your imaginations go wild if you so
desire.

And just so you know, like any other config files used to hack Neovim/Vim, the
Lua code also needs to be placed in the `runtimepath` (_see `:h rtp` for more
info_). These config files (_with a¬†`.lua` file extensions_) are placed inside
the `lua` directory of the `runtimepath`. And Neovim will source everything
inside that directory at runtime.

Do note, the location of the Neovim `runtimepath` varies depending on the choice
of your Operating System (OS). So, for Linux users out there, check if your OS
follows the
[XDG Base Directory](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
specification, then the Lua files should be usually available at:
`$HOME/.config/nvim/lua`. For Windows users out there, you should check for the
Lua files at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\nvim\\lua`.

For more info on where to place the config files, check out the
‚Äú[Where to put Lua files](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide#where-to-put-lua-files)‚Äù
section of the Neovim-Lua Guide on GitHub.

With our little introduction to the optional Lua runtime taken care of, lets
check out the how to configure Neovim keybindings with Lua. The next section
showcases the brand new `vim.keymap.set()` function introduced in Neovim v0.7.
And you'll see how easy as well as maintainable it is use this function rather
than some hacky VimScript code.

## Customising the Neovim Keybindings Using Lua

Back in the day when Neovim wasn‚Äôt a thing, Vim provided the `remap` commands
(_and the_ `noremap` _for non-recursive remaps_) for customising & remapping
keybindings. As such it was a common scene to see the `nnoremap` commands
scattered all over one‚Äôs¬†`.vimrc` file.

Here‚Äôs one such
[_example_ `.vimrc`](https://github.com/jessfraz/.vim/blob/master/vimrc) file I
picked up from the Internet. The file is huge (_~1200 lines of code!_), is
unwieldy & a total nightmare to maintain.

And here‚Äôs a little code snippet I picked up from the¬†**_.vimrc_** file above.

```vimscript
" Example .vimrc file with hundreds of lines of code
...
nnoremap <silent> <leader> :<c-u>WhichKey ','<CR>
nnoremap <leader>? :WhichKey ','<CR>
nnoremap <leader>a :cclose<CR>
nnoremap <leader><space> :nohlsearch<CR>
...
```

Imagine how confusing it would be like to have many such commands spread across
a single `.vimrc` file?

Fortunately though, Neovim v0.7 provides us with a handy `vim.keymaps.set()`
function. This Lua function has the behaviour & functionality as the OG `remap`
commands in VimScript. Hence, there's not much to relearn from scratch.

Regardless, the benefit of using such in-built functions is our configurations
can follow ‚Äú[**DRY**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)‚Äù &
‚Äú[**SOLID**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)‚Äù
principles. Adhering to such common development standard practices means the
configurations looks clean & organised as well.

So what does a typical Neovim configuration look like when used with Lua?

Here‚Äôs an example:

```vimscript
-- Split the windows of the current buffer & change focus on to it.
map.set("n", "ss", ":split<CR><C-w>w") -- Open a horizontal split.
map.set("n", "sv", ":vsplit<CR><C-w>w") -- Open a vertical split.
map.set("n", "sh", "<C-w>h") -- Navigate to the split window on the immediate left.
map.set("n", "sj", "<C-w>j") -- Navigate to the split window below.
map.set("n", "sk", "<C-w>k") -- Navigate to the split window top.
map.set("n", "sl", "<C-w>l") -- Navigate to the split window on the immediate right.
```

At first glance, the Lua code might appear too verbose but it‚Äôs a good thing as
you‚Äôll see soon.

In the Lua code snippet we shared above, we assigned the `vim.keymap` Lua Object
to a locally-scoped variable named `map`. The `map` Object provides us a `set()`
method which accepts four parameters for creating the custom keybindings. As for
what the parameter does is described below:

1.  **_mode_** (_as in Vim modes like_ `Normal` or `Insert` _mode_)
2.  **lhs** (_the custom keybindings you need_)
3.  **rhs** (_the commands or existing keybindings to customise_)
4.  **opts** (_additional options like_ `<silent>` or `<noremap>`, see*
    `:h map-arguments` *for more info on it\*)

By default, the `opts` parameter of the `map.set()` function is assigned to a
table `{ noremap = true }`. In doing so, nested & recursive use of mappings are
allowed (_refer to_ `:h map-commands` _for more info on it_). You can expand the
`opts` table further with additional `map-arguments` as you require.

The `vim.keymap.set()` function can be used anywhere in the configuration files
which helps us create modular config files from anywhere in the `runtimepath`!

#### Final Words & Things to Look Forward¬†to

The optional Lua runtime within Neovim is a godsend & it‚Äôs also one such feature
which makes Neovim particularly stand out apart from Vim. But since the features
& Neovim itself is comparatively new, resources around these features are hard
to come by. As such following are some resources you might want to take a look
at if configuring Neovim with Lua piques your interests.

1.  [A Guide to Using Lua in Neovim](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide)
2.  ‚Äú[`h: lua`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html)‚Äù for a comprehensive guide
    on how to use Lua within Neovim.
3.  And a bit of a shameless plug, you could use my blog as a source of
    reference as well. I‚Äôve written one such articles introducing the benefits
    of using Lua for Neovim in
    [Vim or Neovim? Here‚Äôs Why You Should Use the Latter](https://jarmos.vercel.app/posts/vim-vs-neovim).
    There‚Äôre more such articles to come so keep your eyes peeled.

And to conclude this article, what do you think of using Lua to configure
Neovim? Are your current configuration in VimScript or Lua? And have you noticed
any difference while using either?
