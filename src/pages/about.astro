      <h2>The Programming Languages I Use</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years I've had many opportunities to work on a wide range of
        projects (both professional and personal). And thanks to such
        opportunities I learned to write quite a few programming languages.
        Hence, here is a brief list of programming language I'm either working
        with or have working knowledge of;
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> when
          dealing with small-scale scripts, system automation and/or building
          large scale backend APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.com" target="_blank">TypeScript</a
          > for writing <a href="https://react.dev">React.js</a>-based
          applications for the web.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://lua.org" target="_blank">Lua</a> for help with
          configuring embedded environments like the ones available in <a
            href="https://neovim.io"
            target="_blank">Neovim</a
          >, <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html">Wezterm</a> & <a
            href="https://redis.io/"
            target="_blank">Redis</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">Golang</a> to build fast &
          asynchronous system backends as well as for building
          easy-to-distribute executable binaries.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Primary Frameworks & Libraries</h2>
      <p>
        I've used quite a number of framework/libraries over the years. Some go
        out of trend or have become unusable for a myriad of reasons hence I'm
        not listing all of them here. Some of the said tools in the list are
        even used extensively at Weburz currently!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank">Next.js</a> to build
          modern websites and web applications using a React.js ecosystem of
          tools. The Weburz website is built using Next.js and we've
          open-sourc'ed the project for you (<a
            href="https://github.com/Weburz/weburz.com">source code</a
          >)! ‚ù§Ô∏è
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com" target="_blank">FastAPI</a> to
          build asynchronous REST APIs using Python for our backend services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a> as
          our go-to CSS framework of choice when we want to quickly build a
          simple website or an MVP.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Other Dev Tools in My Belt</h2>
      <p>
        A developer without his/her tools is like Batman without his Batsuit &
        I'm no different! I use a myriad list of other tools besides the one
        mentioned above for tasks like DevOps, writing/editing code and more.
        Hence, here's a list of tools which I use for those purposes;
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>/<a
            href="https://www.debian.org/"
            target="_blank">Debian</a
          > is my primary Operating System of choice for writing code but lately
          I'm experimenting with <a
            href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/"
            target="_blank">WSL2</a
          > and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a>
           as well!
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> for
          containerising projects locally for development and deploying them to
          the cloud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> & <a
            href="https://www.ansible.com/"
            target="_blank">Ansible</a
          > for managing our cloud infrastructure & deployments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://neovim.io" target="_blank">Neovim</a> as my choice of
          a Text Editor to write code! I've configured the tool to be a "<a
            href="https://youtu.be/QMVIJhC9Veg?si=PjcDowVBq34iFopC"
            target="_blank">Personalised Developement Environment (PDE)</a
          >" so if you're interested in how I did it, feel free to check out my <a
            href="https://github.com/Jarmos-san/dotfiles">dotfiles</a
          >.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        That said, as a Software Engineer I'm always on my feet to learn and
        pick up the latest new tools and tricks of the trade. As mentioned
        earlier, listing all of the tools in a single page isn't possible but I
        do promise to keep it updated ever so often for your interests.
