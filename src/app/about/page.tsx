      &quot;!
    </p>

    <p>
      I am Somraj Saha (aka &quot;Jarmos&quot;) and I am a Senior Software
      Engineer working independently! My primary work involves helping
      businesses of all scale solve some of their software engineering probalems
      and contribute (or even create) opensource tools as a hobby and
      recreational purposes. The website you are on right now is where I share
      my knowledge, skills and thoughts as a Software Engineer.

      If you are curious of the technologies and/or the development tools I use
      for work, here is what you should know:

        (or simply Go) is a programming language I am currently learning to
        rewrite some of my CLI tools with. I choose this language because of its

        of my projects.

      Primary Frameworks & Libraries
    </h2>

    <p>
      Although I use quite a few frameworks and libraries on a daily basis but I
      am only listing a few of the primary and most widely used ones here. I am
      generally framework agnostic and will pick up whatever framework does the
      job or is currently widely used by the community.

        importance.

      As mentioned earlier, those are not the only frameworks and libraries I
      work with but the list would be too long to list all of them!

      Other Developer Tools I Use
    </h2>

    <p>
      A Software Engineer is &ldquo;a Batman without his
      Batsuit/Batmobile&rdquo;, hence it is very important for me to choose and
      maintain a bunch of tools I would use on a day-to-day basis to write code
      as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are the rest of the tools which helps me write code with the list of
      technologies mentioned above:

    <p>
      That said, as a Software Engineer I am always on the look out to learn and
      use new technologies. And although I will try my best to keep this page
      updated frequently I would not want to make it a boring read for you. If
      you still want to be updated of the technologies I work with or have plans
      to try out, you might want to follow me on my social media platforms!
