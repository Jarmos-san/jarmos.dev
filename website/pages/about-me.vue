    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there!ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Somraj Saha</strong>, though many of my friends (and
      occasionally my family) call me by my pen name: <em>Jarmos</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to my
      <a
        href="https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-garden"
        target="_blank"
      >
        digital garden
      </a>
      -a space where I share my thoughts, learnings, and experiments as a
      Software Engineer. While most of my writing revolves around Software
      Engineering and Computer Science, I occasionally wander into other
      territories like Financial Economics and Investments.
      <br >
      And in case you're wondering: no, none of this is AI-generated fluff. I do
      use AI to catch typos and polish grammar (English isn't my first
      language), but the ideas and words are all mine.
    </p>

    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
      I currently serve as the
      <strong>Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</strong> at
      <a href="https://weburz.com" target="_blank">Weburz</a>, where I lead our
      engineering and infrastructure efforts. Together with my friend (and
      boss),
      <a href="https://www.sagarkapoor.eu" target="_blank">Sagar Kapoor</a>, we
      build tools and services that help small businesses thrive online. Beyond
      our proprietary work, we're also big on Free and Open-Source Software
      (FOSS)-you can explore some of our projects at our
      <a href="https://github.com/Weburz" target="_blank">GitHub organization</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: despite holding a <strong>Master's degree in Economics</strong>
      from the
      <a href="https://uohyd.ac.in" target="_blank">University of Hyderabad</a>,
      I eventually traded demand curves for code. While I still enjoy reading
      the occasional economics paper, my true passion lies in Computer Science
      and building software that actually helps people. You'll still catch me
      writing about Economics here once in a while-but don't expect a
      supply-demand diagram in every post.
    </p>
    <p>
      My fascination with computers started in my teens, though resources back
      then were scarce. University changed that: access to labs, a community of
      peers, and an environment that encouraged self-learning. I'm forever
      grateful for the people who supported my journey from those days to where
      I am now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I find joy in knowing my work has a real-world impact. If you've
      benefited from something I've built or written, I'd love to hear from you!

    <h2>My Developer Toolkit</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've worked with a dizzying number of technologies. Here's
      a curated list of the ones I keep closest to my heart (and fingertips):
    </p>

    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> -my go-to
        for server-side applications, microservices, and automation scripts.
        It's clean, reliable, and easier on the eyes than Bash.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>
        -for building web applications with type safety, especially with
        <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://lua.org" target="_blank">Lua</a> -a niche but powerful
        language I mainly use to customize tools like
        <a href="https://neovim.io" target="_blank">Neovim</a>,
        <a href="https://wezterm.org" target="_blank">WezTerm</a>, and
        <a href="https://redis.io" target="_blank">Redis</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">Go</a> -my choice for writing
        performance-sensitive software, particularly CLI tools that need to be
        distributed as binaries. (Yes, I'm that person who gets excited about
        small executables.)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Frameworks & Libraries</h3>
    <p>
      Here are some frameworks that make my developer life easier (and more
      enjoyable):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://nuxt.com" target="_blank">Nuxt.js</a> -for building
        modern, responsive, and SEO-friendly web apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com" target="_blank">FastAPI</a> -my
        go-to for building REST APIs in Python, complete with auto-generated
        docs that feel like cheating (in the best way possible).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://ui.nuxt.com" target="_blank">NuxtUI</a> -a lightweight
        component library that makes MVP development feel like a sprint, not a
        marathon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://cobra.dev" target="_blank">Cobra</a> -for structuring
        Go CLI apps, plus handy extras like auto-completions and man pages. (Why
        reinvent the wheel when someone's already rolled out a good one?)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Honorable mentions:
      <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank">Next.js</a>,
      <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>,
      <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com" target="_blank">Flask</a>,
      <a href="https://pytorch.org" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>,
      <a href="https://scikit-learn.org" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a>, and
      more-because the list never truly ends.
    </p>

    <h3>Other Tools I Rely On</h3>
    <p>
      My work doesn't stop at writing code-there's DevOps, infra, and general
      tinkering involved too. Here are some of the tools I keep in my toolkit:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> /
        <a href="https://fedoraproject.org" target="_blank">Fedora</a> for
        development, <a href="https://debian.org" target="_blank">Debian</a> for
        deployments. I also use WSL 2 on a Windows laptop (not my favorite, but
        hey-compromise is part of engineering).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> -because
        without it, I'd constantly hear
        <a
          href="https://www.donthitsave.com/comic/2016/07/15/it-works-on-my-computer"
          target="_blank"
          >"but it works on my machine"</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform" target="_blank"
          >Terraform</a
        >
        & <a href="https://www.ansible.com" target="_blank">Ansible</a> -for
        provisioning and managing infrastructure as code, because SSH'ing into
        boxes manually gets old fast.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://neovim.io" target="_blank">Neovim</a> -my editor of
        choice, tailored into a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/QMVIJhC9Veg" target="_blank"
          >personalized development environment</a
        >. My
        <a href="https://github.com/Jarmos-san/dotfiles" target="_blank"
          >dotfiles</a
        >
        are open if you'd like to borrow ideas for your own setup.
      </li>
    </ol>
